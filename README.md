# uwx/refinedstorage
This is a fork of [Refined Storage](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage) a Minecraft Forge mod for mass storing items.
This version has separate insert/extract priority settings for storage items, designed so that you can still store items normally
while using a ProjectE Transmutation Table to keep backup copies of all your items.

For more information, see the original project's [README](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage#refined-storage--).

## Using the priority settings
Rather than the priority field being an integer, it's now two integers delimited by a comma (`,`). The increment and decrement buttons
will likely not do what you intend; instead, you should type the values manually into the field.
